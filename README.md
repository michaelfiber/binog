# binog
My little web thing for running bingo games.

## About
If you click to pick a number, it picks one and shows it to you. It keeps track and won't repeat. Hit reset to restart your game. It picks numbers from 1 to 75. 

## Building
The TSX files are concatenated and dumped into index.html at the `/*{{tsx}}*/` token. I have a small program to this which isn't included. The finished build is in the build directory.

## Note:
The card generation doesn't work well yet.
